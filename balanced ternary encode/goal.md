# Balanced ternary computer: encode
*A contribution by BorisZ*

Balanced ternary(3 base) is a non-standard positional numeral system. In the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, digits have values 0, 1 and 2. The digits in the balanced ternary system have values âˆ’1, 0, and 1. We use letter T to represent -1, so the digits are (T, 0, 1).

    E.g.: 1T0 = 1 * (3**2) + (-1)*(3**1) + 0*(3**0) = 9 - 3 + 0 = 6

You must convert input integer (decimal) number to its balanced ternary representation.
